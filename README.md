npm install react react-dom
The project uses Vite for fast development and HMR (Hot Module Replacement).
There are two official plugins for React: @vitejs/plugin-react (Babel) and @vitejs/plugin-react-swc (SWC).
The React Compiler is not enabled by default, but you can add it by following the documentation.
For production apps, it recommends using TypeScript and expanding ESLint rules, with a link to the TypeScript template for Vite.
